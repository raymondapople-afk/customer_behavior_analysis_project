# customer_behavior_analysis_project
Data analytics portfolio project 1, showcasing customer purchase behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end data analytics workflow: from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.
The focus is on practical analytics execution — data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL querying, and clear visual communication through dashboards and reports.

The output is designed for non-technical stakeholders, with insights delivered via Power BI, a written report, and a presentation.

Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported raw dataset using Python

Validated schema, data types, and row counts

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies

Analyzed distributions and trends

Performed basic correlation and segmentation analysis

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and invalid values

Standardised column names and formats

Created derived fields and business metrics

Prepared clean tables for SQL and BI consumption

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into relational databases

Wrote analytical SQL queries including:

Aggregations and groupings

Joins across tables

Window functions for ranking and trends

Validated SQL outputs against Python results

5. Dashboard Development

Built a Power BI dashboard focused on:

Key KPIs

Trends over time

Segment and regional performance

Designed for clarity, usability, and stakeholder relevance

6. Reporting & Presentation

Produced a written analytical report summarising findings

Created a presentation using Gamma to communicate insights and recommendations

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

High-level KPI overview

Time-series trends

Breakdown by key dimensions (e.g. region, product, customer segment)

Filters for interactive exploration

Screenshots or a PBIX link can be added here.

Results & Insights

Key outcomes from the analysis:

Identified performance trends and anomalies

Highlighted top-performing and under-performing segments

Quantified impact using clear, measurable metrics

Provided actionable recommendations based on data evidence

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/raymondapople-afk/customer_behavior_analysis_project.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Set Up Python Environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Analysis

Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the /notebooks folder

Ensure database credentials are configured before running SQL scripts

4. SQL Setup

Create the database in PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Run the SQL scripts in /sql to create tables and queries

5. Power BI

Update data source connections if required

Project Purpose

This project exists to demonstrate:

Strong fundamentals in data analysis and SQL

Ability to turn messy data into clear insights

Competence in business-facing reporting and dashboards

An understanding of end-to-end analytics workflows, not just isolated tools
